# Data-Structures-in-Clojure
These are test-driven data structures I made in Clojure.
I created this repository when I took my data structure course. (and cloned it to github)
The folders were generated by Leiningen ( http://leiningen.org/ )

All structures operate on immutable data (except dlist-atom)
immutable data is threadsafe (i.e. since it can not be edited all threads can have simultanous access)

The Recur command identifies tail recursion, but I only learned about it recently.

Tests are in the spec folder
Source code is in the src folder
The structures are in the corresponding folders core.clj file

Key:

bst:            Binary Search Tree.

dlist-atom:     Doubly Linked List (mutable through the use of the 'atom' object)

fifolifo:       Queues and Stacks (First In First Out, Last In First Out)

first-one:      Practice file to get the hang of Leiningen

linked-list:    Singly Linked List

reports:        the results of varius test cases

traversal-lab:  binary tree traversals
